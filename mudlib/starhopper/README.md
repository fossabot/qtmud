STARHOPPER
##########

After an unfortunate situation, the ship's autopilot pulls you from 
cryogenic sleep.

Your ship, part of humanity's exodus to New Earth, is safe most of the 
time, thanks to your ship's faster-than-light drive maintaining a 
protective warp bubble. However, real interstellar travel must be done 
through hops, which leave you vulnerable.

As you get closer to New Earth, the challenges you will lead your crew 
through get harder. Coordinate your actions, or sabotage each other. 
After all, only one of you can be the first to reach New Earth and be 
the **savior of humanity**.
