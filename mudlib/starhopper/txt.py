Our ship's computer (that's me!) randomly selected YOU as the lucky soul to be
painfully jarred out of your cryogenic stasis. The fate of your crew,
and perhaps humanity itself, is in your hands. Congratulations!

I'd recommend checking the ship's "status". You can "scan" and "survey" the
local system, but be warned - any interaction with things in space means
dropping out of warp, leaving you vulnerable.

Once you have your bearings and a plan, you can "hop" forward through space to
take one interstellar step toward our destination. If you need to go
backward, simply "hop back".
