The MUD Driver
--------------

The MUD driver is the "engine" that makes a MUD happen.  In qtMUD, the
driver's main responsibility is maintaining a list of
subscriptions and events.  Subscriptions are functions that will be
called when an event is scheduled.

qtMUD provides very few subscriptions itself.  Most are added through
services.  qtMUD comes with several services, but its expected that
more will be added by a MUD library.

The MUD Library
---------------

The MUD library is a bundle of services added to the driver, usually to add game features.


The `qtmud` Command
-------------------

The MUD driver - and its library - are most often accessed through the `qtmud` command.
