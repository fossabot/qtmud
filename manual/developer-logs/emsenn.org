* <2018-12-15 Sat 12:01>: Getting Back Into It
It's been a few years since I've looked at this project, but I think
my life is getting back to a point where I'd like to give it some more
thought.  And, luckily, it seems like I'll be able to get started
relatively easily: the code seems to work, and has at least /some/
documentiation, even if it isn't as well-written as I'd prefer these
days.

I'm taking my first order of business to be refamiliarizing myself
with the project's layout, reading the documentation, and learning how
to rebuild the documentation.
