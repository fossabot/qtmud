qtMUD is a **Python 3** package for developing and managing a
multi-user dimension, or :term:`MUD`, written by `emsenn
<https://emsenn.net/>`_ and released under the `Unlicense
<https://unlicense.org/>`_.  It is currently in **early alpha**.

This documentation is intended to serve as documentation for those
administrating or using a qtMUD server.  The official version of this
documentation is hosted at `https://qtmud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
<https://qtmud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

MUDs are a form of multi-player game where players receive verbose
text descriptions of their environments and the activity around
them, and interact by typing out commands for what they wish to do,
such as ``survey planet`` or ``fight dragon``.

By providing a limited set of features and focusing on
documentation, qtMUD aims to be the non-programmer's way to create
and run a MUD.

.. note:: qtMUD is just the core server for running a MUD, and is
	  meant to be used with a MUD library, like `Fyreside
	  <https://fyreside.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_.
