`Fyreside <https://fyreside.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a library for running a talker-style MUD: all the gameplay happens adjacent to the in-game chat.  Players have health, armor, and mana, and are able to draw cards from a shared deck, with the goal being to do the most harm to other players without dying yourself.
