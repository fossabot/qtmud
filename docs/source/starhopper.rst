starhopper package
##################

Starhopper is the first :term:`mudlib` built for :doc:`qtmud`.

In Starhopper, new players awake as starship captains, part of a scattered
fleet fleeing from their homeland to a new world.

As you get closer to New Earth, the challenges you will lead your crew
through get harder.
