Fireside
########

Fireside is a the most lightweight :term:`mudlib` built for :doc:`qtMUD`.
Building on the :class:`Talker <qtmud.services.Talker>`, Fireside allocates
mana to players based on how much they talk on the various talker
:term:`channels <channel>`.

These mana points can be spent to play cards, which generally either hurt
other players or help yourself.
