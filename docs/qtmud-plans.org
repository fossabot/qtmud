** [1/11] 0.1.0
For version ~0.1.0~, I plan on polishing the existing features and
increasing their functionality.  Any /new/ features should be
delayed to version [[0.2.0]].
*** TODO Rewrite documentation as manual
*** TODO Define development method
*** TODO Write test coverage
*** DONE Re-write service script
So it looks like since the last time I worked on qtMUD, CLINT stopped
being maintained.  (It was the library I was using for command
parsing.)  I had planned to re-write the qtmud_run script to use CLINT
instead of argparser, but now I'm going to replace it - and CLINT's
use in the engine proper - with "click", which seems to be more robust
in some ways, though not as featureful in others.
*** TODO Write test for service start/stop
*** TODO Create talker channel for login notifications
*** TODO Create process for gaining admin rights
Player can enter a command, ~admin request~, and the console log
will print a token, which can then be used by that player to claim
admin rights.
*** TODO Update in-game help command
Create a global constant for HELP_URI or something similar, and then
change the help command to output the first two paragraphs (the
blurb and either in-game syntax or brief overview)

  Global constant qtmud.HELP_URI Within cmds.help parse out the
  first two paragraphs First two paragraphs should be blurb & either
  syntax or non-marked up overview. Add this to docs/development.rst
  How detailed should help be? Right now it's limited to the
  commands the player has, active services, and subscribers. Should
  the user be able to look deeper?
*** TODO Clients without names show up in ~who~
*** TODO Write username validator
*** TODO Rewrite qtmud_run to use CLINT
