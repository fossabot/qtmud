qtMUD is a Python package for developing and managing a multi-user dimension,
or :term:`MUD` , written by `emsenn <https://github.com/emsenn/>`_
and released under the `WTFPL <http://www.wtfpl.com>`_.


MUDs are a form of multi-player game where players receive verbose text
descriptions of their environments and the activity around them, and interact
by typing out commands for what they wish to do, such as ``survey planet`` or
``fight dragon``.

By providing a clearly documented API, qtMUD aims to be the
non-programmer's way to create and run a MUD.


.. note:: qtMUD is just the core API for running a MUD. If you want an
          example of a simple game built using qtMUD, check out
          `Fireside <https://fireside.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_.
